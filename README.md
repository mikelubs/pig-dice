#### A simple dice game

#### By Lubembe

## Description

Create players and take turns rolling two dice. If both dice show 1, your turn ends and you lose your entire score. If only one die shows 1, you turn ends and you won't earn any points for that round. If neither die shows 1, add the two die values to your score. You can continue rolling until you roll a 1 or choose to end your turn.
